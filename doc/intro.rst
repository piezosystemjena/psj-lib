Welcome to psj-lib
------------------

**psj-lib** is a comprehensive Python library for controlling piezoelectric amplifiers and control devices 
manufactured by `piezosystem jena GmbH <https://www.piezosystem.com>`_. The library provides an intuitive, 
asynchronous interface for precise position control, waveform generation, data acquisition, and advanced 
control system configuration.


What is psj-lib?
----------------

psj-lib is designed to provide researchers, engineers, and developers with a powerful yet easy-to-use 
Python interface for piezosystem jena devices. The library abstracts the complexity of low-level device 
communication while exposing the full capabilities of the hardware.

**Key Features:**

* **Asynchronous Architecture**: Built on Python's asyncio for efficient, non-blocking device communication
* **Multi-Device Support**: Extensible framework supporting multiple device families (currently d-Drive)
* **Comprehensive Capabilities**: Full access to position control, PID tuning, waveform generation, data recording, and filtering
* **Multiple Transport Protocols**: Connect via Serial (USB) or Telnet (Ethernet)
* **Type-Safe API**: Complete type hints for excellent IDE autocomplete and type checking
* **Extensive Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings, examples, and developer guides


Supported Devices
-----------------

d-Drive Modular Amplifiers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **d-Drive** series represents piezosystem jena's modular piezo amplifier family, offering:

* **High Resolution**: 20-bit DAC/ADC for precision control
* **Fast Sampling**: 50 kHz (20 µs period) for responsive control
* **Modular Design**: 1-6 channel configurations in compact enclosure
* **Advanced Control**: Integrated PID controller with configurable filters
* **Waveform Generation**: Built-in function generator with scan modes
* **Data Acquisition**: 2-channel recorder with 500,000 samples per channel
* **Hardware Triggers**: Precise timing and synchronization


Architecture Overview
---------------------

The psj-lib library follows a hierarchical architecture:

.. code-block:: text

    PiezoDevice (Base Class)
    ├── Device-level operations
    ├── Channel discovery
    └── Transport protocol management
        │
        └── PiezoChannel (Base Class)
            ├── Channel-level operations
            └── Capability management
                │
                └── Capabilities (Features)
                    ├── Status and monitoring
                    ├── Position control
                    ├── Closed-loop controller
                    ├── PID tuning
                    ├── Filter configuration
                    ├── Waveform generation
                    └── Data recording

**Three-Layer Design:**

1. **Device Layer**: Manages device connection, discovery, and channel enumeration
2. **Channel Layer**: Provides access to individual amplifier channels
3. **Capability Layer**: Exposes specific hardware features as composable capabilities


Design Philosophy
-----------------

Capability-Based Architecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Instead of a monolithic device class, psj-lib uses **capabilities** to represent hardware features. 
Each capability is a focused module that encapsulates related functionality:

.. code-block:: python

    # Access capabilities as channel attributes
    await channel.closed_loop_controller.set(True)
    await channel.setpoint.set(50.0)
    await channel.pid_controller.set(p=0.5, i=0.1, d=0.05)

This design provides:

* **Clarity**: Clear separation of concerns
* **Discoverability**: Easy to explore available features via autocomplete
* **Maintainability**: Easy to extend with new capabilities
* **Type Safety**: Each capability has proper type hints


Asynchronous by Default
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All device communication is asynchronous, enabling:

* **Concurrent Operations**: Control multiple channels simultaneously
* **Non-blocking**: Keep UI responsive while waiting for device responses
* **Efficient**: Minimize idle time in complex sequences
* **Scalable**: Handle multiple devices without threading complexity

.. code-block:: python

    # Concurrent channel control
    await asyncio.gather(
        channel1.setpoint.set(30.0),
        channel2.setpoint.set(60.0),
        channel3.setpoint.set(90.0)
    )


Transport Abstraction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The library abstracts transport protocols, allowing seamless switching between Serial and Telnet:

.. code-block:: python

    # Serial connection
    device = DDriveDevice(TransportType.SERIAL, "COM3")
    
    # Or Telnet connection
    device = DDriveDevice(TransportType.TELNET, "192.168.1.100")

The same API works regardless of transport type.
